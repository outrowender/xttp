# Xttp

## A lightweight HTTP client written in Swift

<img src="assets/xttp.png" width="1000px"/>

## Features

* âœ… 100% macOS native
* âœ… Instant boot
* âœ… No accounts required

## Roadmap

This obviously is not ready for production and have many more features to go. Some of them are:
* ðŸ“¥ Better JSON visual formatting
* ðŸ“¥ Import and Export requests
* ðŸ“¥ HTML Preview
* ðŸ“¥ WS Support
* ðŸ“¥ Bug fixes
* ðŸ“¥ iPad app
* ðŸ“¥ Shortcuts integration

## Why?
I hate greedy, electron based HTTP clients: they're heavy and takes a long time to boot. 
I just want to use something light and that doesn't require an account or signature to use it after I finished my migration.


Still WIP. Help me to catch bugs and make this run smoother.
